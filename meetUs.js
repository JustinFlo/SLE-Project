I have a big passion for music and video games, and although I've never really worked with technology before, this experience has opened my mind to it. I've learned that I need to be patient, take my time, and not rush things. I also really found that it was difficult to put a piece together online, being a musician it was like opening up a whole different world to me. But I'm so glad I did so because it has been such a great experience, and I'm so proud of the music I was able to make.",

As I moved to high school I wanted to continue TSA and competed in Future Technology and Engineering Teacher, placing 2nd at the state level, and in Fashion Design and Technology last year. TSA has taught me invaluable skills and helped me gain a middle school friend group I still love while learning more about the technical world around us.",
